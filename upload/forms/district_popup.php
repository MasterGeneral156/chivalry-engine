				<b>Guild District Beta</b><br />
				Very simply, there's a couple mechanics not yet implemented. This is mainly to test the structure of the mod itself to 
				be sure it is capabale of what we already have asked of it. At this moment, you may not hire generals yet, and you will not 
				receive a discount when purchasing troops if you hold a market tile.<br />
				We haven't implemented any rewards yet, in case this mod ends up being super game breaking. Note, however, guilds that participate 
				in the beta will be rewarded handsomely by CID Admin once it becomes stable.
				<hr />
                Think of the districts just like the game of Risk. The districts are played on a guild-level, and everything 
				is funded from the guilt itself. To advance and become a powerful contender on the guild districts board, 
				you must have a very active guild, lots of members. The goal is to reward both the well established players, 
				and those who strive really hard to be the best.<hr />
				<b>Units</b><br />
				There's three units in the districts: Warriors, Archers and Generals. Warriors are melee units, who get up and 
				personal with the enemy. Without proper archer cover, however, they're good as gone. Likewise, archers without a 
				frontline of Warriors are toast.<br />
				Generals are a purely defensive unit which may be assigned to tiles you own. This grants that tile an extra 50% defense 
				buff.
				<hr />
				<b>District Tiles</b><br />
				Tiles can very easily be identified by the color of their background and border.<br />
				Blue Tiles - Water.<br />
				Green tiles - Tile owned by your guild.<br />
				Red tiles - Tile owned by others.<br />
				Green Border - Fortified tile owned by your guild.<br />
				Red border - Fortified tile owned by other guild.<br />
				Yellow border - High ground. (10% defense/offense)<br />
				White border - Low ground (-10% defense/offense)<br />
				Blue border - Market (-10% troop cost, does not stack)
				<hr />
				<b>Getting Started</b><br />
				To get on the board, you must attack the outside tiles, and then make your way in. You may attack in any direction 
				from a tile.<br />
				Recruit troops for your guild via Guild Info. The amount of troops you may recruit per day is limited by 
				how many active players you have in your guild.
				<hr />
				<b>Movement</b><br />
				Each day, your guild will be given two movements to spend on transferring troops, attacking, or however you 
				see fit. You may get an extra two turns if you successfully attack and conquer a tile. Most actions, other than 
				buying troops, exhausts a movement point.
				<hr />
				<b>Upkeep</b><br />
				Units actively on duty cost your guild! You will be charged for each unit currently on the board. Warriors on 
				cost your guild 500 Copper Coins, Archers cost your guild 1,000 Copper Coins, and Generals cost your guild 
				12,500 Copper Coins. This is taken from your guild's vault once a day.
