# Chivalry Engine
Chivalry Engine is a free to use and open source engine created by TheMasterGeneral. Built on top of Bootstrap V4, Chivalry Engine is a mobile-first experience. It should work well on any modern device/browser.

# Requirements
A web-server with PHP 7.0+ and MySQLi support. Users need to have Javascript enabled or a lot of the core features won't work. With the inclusion of Bootstrap V4, you cannot run this engine on clients running Internet Explorer 9 or older. Its recommended that users on Android use a browser different to the default one, unless they're running Android 5.0 or newer.  
  
# Live Game
Want to give v1 of the engine a test in a live game instance? Check out [Chivalry is Dead](https://chivalryisdeadgame.com)!
 
# Goals for V3
Chivalry Engine V3 is a full rewrite of Chivalry Engine with an object-orientated programming style in mind. This hopefully makes life easier when developing and running a game on Chivalry Engine. This will likely not be compatible with previous version of Chivalry Engine.
