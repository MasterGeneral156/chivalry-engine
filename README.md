# Chivalry Engine
Chivalry Engine is a free to use and open source engine created by TheMasterGeneral. Built on top of Bootstrap, Chivalry Engine is a mobile-first experience. It should work swell on any modern device.

Chivalry Engine is incomplete, however, for those interested in the development cycle, feel free to star the repository. We're trying to limit builds to once a week, just so you don't have to constantly check back here.

If you run into issues, or wish to add your own modules, fork the repository and your changes. When complete, submit a well documented pull request!

# Requirements
A web-server with PHP 7.0+ and MySQLi support. Users need to have Javascript enabled or a lot of the core features won't work.  
  
  # Live Game
Want to give the engine a test in a live game instance? Check out [Chivalry is Dead](https://chivalryisdeadgame.com)!
