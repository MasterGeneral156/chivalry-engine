# Chivalry Engine
Chivalry Engine is a free to use and open source engine created by TheMasterGeneral. Built on top of Bootstrap V4, Chivalry Engine is a mobile-first experience. It should work well on any modern device/browser.

# Requirements
A web-server with PHP 7.0+ and MySQLi support. Users need to have Javascript enabled or a lot of the core features won't work.  
  
# Live Game

# Goals for V2
Chivalry Engine V2 is suppose to be an iteration upon Chivalry Engine V1, fixing many shortcomings, and changing things based on the main developer's experience change. V2 will not be a drop-in upgrade from V1! You will not be given support for such a situation.

# Major Changes in V2
Chivalry Engine V2 brings a new UI to the engine, making it stand out from Chivalry Engine V1. Item usage effects are now stored in json, making it possible to create items with essentially infinite effects. Chivalry Engine V2 also stores game variables (such as Currency names) in the main configuration file to make changing the game-specific names easier for game owners. Chivalry Engine V2 comes with FontAwesome 5 out of the box. Many functions got a rewrite. The API was also rewritten to be much more clear for developers to work with. Chivalry Engine V2 also removes several modules such as FraudGuard support, town taxing, poking other players, player classes/roles, and the permission system. Chivalry Engine V2 is believed to be much more secure compared to it's V1 counterpart. Check back often for more changes listed here.
